/// object a few points away from the first, and that is not what the machine
/// looks like: the eye finds the gap and reads a mistake. So the notch now
/// starts *inside* the hole and flows out of it — the leading end loses its
/// flare, holds the hole's own depth as far as the hole's wall, and steps down
/// onto the bar's far side with no bend at either join.
///
/// Every test here measures the drawn path in screen points, because that is
/// the only space in which "does it line up with the hole" is a question. The
/// mapping is the view's own: the shape is drawn in design points, scaled by
/// the size setting from the bezel, pushed `bezelBleed` past it, and laid into
/// the panel at `notchAlongLead`.
