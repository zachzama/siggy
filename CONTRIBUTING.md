## Building

```sh
brew install xcodegen create-dmg   # once — project.yml generates the .xcodeproj
make build               # Debug build, ad-hoc signed
make test                # unit tests
make run                 # build and launch
```

None of these need an Apple Developer account. `xcodebuild` ad-hoc signs a
Debug build automatically, which is enough to run and debug locally.

A note on the keychain, because it is not only a development annoyance. A
keychain item has an access list, which is what "Always Allow" writes to, and a
*partition list*, which nothing in the GUI ever writes to. An app outside the
partition list is refused before the access list is consulted, so approving the
dialogue is good for one read. Claude Code recreates its keychain items on every
token rotation, and a new item's partition list admits only Apple's own tools —
which refuses a properly signed release build as surely as an ad-hoc one.

So `ClaudeCredentials.read` never shows the dialogue from a background refresh:
interaction is switched off for the read, and a refusal is retried through
`/usr/bin/security`, which is Apple-signed and on the item's access list. The
one read that may prompt is the one somebody clicks **Allow access…** for in
Settings. To stop the refusal happening at all, `Scripts/fix-keychain-partitions.sh`
adds Codenotch's Team ID to those items' partition lists — once, with your login
password.

`make release TEAM_ID=<team>` is different: it archives, signs with a
Developer ID certificate and notarizes with Apple. Siggy has no auto-update
feed. You won't need it to contribute.

## Before opening a PR

- `make test` passes.
- New behavior has a test. `Tests/` mirrors `Sources/` by concern, not by
  file — look for the existing test class closest to what you're changing
  before adding a new one.
- If you're changing layout math in `Sources/Notch/NotchLayout.swift`, check it
  against `docs/design/frame-124-hover-tooltip.png` — every constant there is
  quoted from that frame in design-frame pixels via `Design.px(_:)`.

## Code style

- Comments explain **why**, not what — a hidden constraint, a bug a piece of
  code works around, a design decision that would otherwise look arbitrary.
  If removing a comment wouldn't confuse the next reader, it shouldn't be
  there.
- No premature abstraction. Three similar lines beat an early helper.
- A provider adapter (`Sources/Providers/`) should degrade every failure to a
  visible, honest status — `stale`, `needsAuth`, `accessDenied`, `error` — and
  never invent a number. See `UsageProviderError` and `ProviderStatus`.

## Visible copy

- User-visible strings (settings, menus, tooltips, notifications, What's New,
  provider labels and status) go through `L10n.t("English source")`. The
  English source **is** the key.
- English is the source language. Put optional translations in
  `Sources/Localizable.xcstrings`. A missing translation falls back to
  English and must not fail tests — do not gate CI on any locale being
  complete.
- Don't freeze `L10n.t` in a `static let` — lookup has to see the current
  language.
- Follow System plus the in-app Language setting; don't set `AppleLanguages`.
- Windows `windows/codenotch/src/i18n.rs` is a separate system — don't merge
  the two.

## Adding a provider

Implement `UsageProvider` (`Sources/Providers/UsageProvider.swift`). At
minimum:

- Declare a `Fidelity` — `.official` if the number comes from the vendor's own
  endpoint or local state, `.derived` if you computed it yourself (the
  tooltip prefixes a `~`), `.manual` if it's a placeholder.
- Every failure path should map to a `ProviderStatus`, not throw something the
  UI can't render — see how `ClaudeOAuthProvider` and `CodexLocalProvider`
  handle theirs.
- If the credential lives in the keychain, hold it with `CredentialCache`
  rather than reading on every poll — see its doc comment for why.

## Reporting a bug

Include the unified log around the time it happened:

```sh
/usr/bin/log show --last 10m --predicate 'subsystem == "com.zachzama.siggy"' --info --debug
```
